\title{The Solar Trapper}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
\begin{abstract}
    The Solar Trapper is a project to find a cheap and simple way to heat houses for those who are unable to afford heating. 
    The solution to this issue is to create a system that automatically closes the curtains when the sun no longer heats the house, 
    insulating it from loosing its heat and therefore saving money on heating.

    While originally intended to be a group project for submission to the PA Consulting Raspberry Pi competition, 
    none of the original members made a contribution to the project.
    Everything described here is released\cite{url:repo} under a permissive free and open source MIT license.

\section{Introduction}

In Britain, many people face the issue of freezing due to the inability to heat. 
Indoor heating is a massive energy consumer in the UK, responsible for about 20\% of greenhouse gas emissions\cite{url:energyUse}. 
This not only contributes to climate change but also leads to unsustainable expenses for households who need to heat during winter.

The aim of this project is to develop a device that permits people to make more use of solar energy to heat their rooms, 
while still keeping the cost of hardware and installing the system low. 

The potential of using solar energy is significant, about $1.3 KW/m^2$ \cite{url:solarConstant}. 
Even if the majority of the energy is lost to its surroundings and only $500 W/m^2$ are captured, 
this may save up to $5 Kwh$, or the equivalent of 1 Kg of firewood for each $m^2$ of a south-facing window. 

\subsection{Photovoltaics for room heating}

An obvious choice to start with would be photovoltaic panels, using the generated electricity to heat the water used in the heaters, 
but a cursory market study of available components indicates that an adequately sized photovoltaic system (roughly 2kW of power) 
would cost roughly £4000\cite{url:solarEnergyStore}, well above the budget of a typical person in need of additional heating  
and with an unclear amortisation schedule. 
Therefore, photovoltaics were ruled out for electric heating.

\subsection{Air collectors for room heating}

Another method that was considered was using air collectors for room heating, which work by using solar energy to heat the air, which is then circulated into a room. 
They are simple and robust as well as providing fresh air to the room, ensuring the house does not grow moist when the owner is away for longer periods. 
However, they are very expensive at roughly £2200 for 2kW heating output\cite{url:solarVenti}. Also, they are difficult to install and often only ideal for a permanent home, 
so those renting a house - generally those who require it the most - would be unable to make use of it.

\subsection{Window insulation}

A very cost effective way of keeping the temperature up in a room is to open curtains when the sun is heating the space through the window, 
and then close the curtains when the temperature starts to fall again in the evening. 
The issue with this is that many people are away at work during the optimal time for closing the curtains.

For this reason, the most prudent course of action for this project was decided to be to design a system that automatically closes the curtains at the optimal time, 
letting the sun in only while it still effectively heats. 

In addition, this system is very simple and cheap, which would allow those who need this extra insulation to afford it.

The system designed closes the curtains when the sun goes away or the temperature in the room starts to drop, so as to keep the solar heat inside 
and reduce heating costs.

It has a detector that can sense very bright light (i.e., the sun), a sensor to measure the temperature accurately and an actuator to 
release a curtain closing mechanism, which is triggered when the sun has vanished for a certain time or becomes too weak to effectively heat the room.
 The system does not respond immediately, so that wrong measurements or reappearance of the sun do not result in reduced energy harvesting.


For cost reasons, the system does not support opening curtains automatically, as was originally intended. Instead, the user needs to reset these manually.
Closing works by releasing a weight with a servo arm. The potential energy of the weight moves the curtain via a simple pulley system.

Subsequent to closing action, the locking mechanism moves back into the original position for convenience in resetting the weight and curtain 
for the next day.

    \caption{Curtain system: Open and closed state. Teddy bear represents weight.}
    \label{fig:CurtainMechanismOpen}
\end{figure*}

One of the main challenges was to design a mechanism that could close the curtains in a cheap and reliable way. 
An example of such a rather complex and costly system is shown in Figure \ref{fig:initialCurtainMechanism}.
The initial design was a similar system on a large curtain.

While seemingly simple at the start, the design quickly became less than ideal, as it would require additional sensors to signal the motor to stop, 
and the resistance between the curtain and the railing was so great that the pulley connected to the motor could not overcame it. Both of these problems were solvable, 
but the cost would be increased significantly. Therefore the decision was made to design a novel system:

A weight is connected to the curtain, to be released by a servo. The weight would fall and provide the energy to close the curtain. 
The user has to reset the curtain when the sun is about to heat the room again in the next morning. Although this system is only able to close curtains, 
it provides the cheap and simple option required.

Using fishing wire and a pulley reduced friction to acceptable levels. This permitted the wire to roll around the pulley several times, ensuring that it would not slip off. 
A Newtonmetre indicated roughly 0.4 N of force were needed  - the equivalent of an average size teddy bear. It worked perfectly first time, but fixing the pulley firmly 
required super glue as hot glue on its own was not strong enough. Afterwards, the servo was attatched under it, to be connected to a loop at the bottom.


\subsection{Sensor selection criteria}

In order for the system to accurately judge the optimal time to close the curtain, external sensors would be required.
Selection criteria for sensors include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Cost
    \item Robustness
    \item Measurement accuracy
    \item Simple to integrate
    \item Availability
\end{itemize}

The data it requires would be the amount of energy going into the room and the energy going out. Thus, the options were:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A temperature sensor - measure the temperature to determine when the temperature drops and ensure the Photoresistor does not act when the sun goes behind a cloud.
    \item A UV detector - measure the strength of the suns rays.
    \item A Photoresistor (A light sensor) - measure how bright it is, if the sun has gone down and to get a quicker reaction than the temperature sensor.
    \item A Photo Diode (A faster-responding light sensor) - as the Photoresistor.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[h!]
    \caption{Sensor trade study. 5 = perfect, o = terrible}
    \begin{tabular}{l | l | l | l | l | l}
        Sensor & Price & Availability & Accuracy & Simplicity & Total\\
        \hline
        Photo Resistor & 4 & 5 & 4 & 2 & 14 \\
        Temperature Sensor & 4 & 4 & 4 & 5 & 17 \\
        Photo Diode & 1 & 4 & 5 & 3 & 13 \\
        UV detector & 1 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 7 \\

    \end{tabular}
    \label{tab:sensor}

\end{table}

As seen in the trade study in Table \ref{tab:sensor}, the Temperature sensor and the Photo Resistor scored the highest points. 
While the Photo Diode would be very accurate, it is unneccessarily expensive when a Photoresistor would do just fine. 
A UV sensor has a high price and needs to be placed outside to work effectively, which would make the process of installing it too complicated. 
Therefore, the final selection were a Temperature Sensor and a photoresistor as the sensors for the curtain system.

\subsection{Equipment}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              

Table \ref{tab:equipment} lists the parts that were required while building this project. This shows that this design is a very economic solution,
as most of the costs come from the model parts. On an actual curtain, the cost would likely be an estimated £30, affordable by most people.

\section{Project execution}

For demonstrations and work in school, the hardware needs to be easily transportable. Hence, rather than a fixed install of a full sized system,  a model was built. 
The result is the stand with a model curtain seen in Figure \ref{fig:curtainSys}.

\begin{figure}

    \end{subfigure}
 
    \caption{Model system: System is activating after temperature and light levels drop.}
    \label{fig:curtainSys}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Hardware Assembly}

The following parts and tools were used in assembling the model:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Servo
    \item Weight
    \item Fishing Wire
    \item Pulley and a suitable Axle, loose enough to spin with relative ease.
    \item DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
    \item LDR Photo Resistor (Light Sensor)
    \item Raspberry Pi
    \item Arduino Nano
    \item Micro SD Card
    \item Wires
    \item Hot Glue Gun
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Release System}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/curtainDetailViewSide.png}
        \caption{Release System: Servo, pulley and light sensor are fitted to the blue bracket.

        \caption{Wiring on the RPi:

    \end{subfigure}

    \caption{Close-up of release system components.}
    \label{fig:closeUpOfSys}
\end{figure}

The following steps are to install the system responsible for closing the curtain. Be careful to place the parts in the correct location, 
to avoid the wire from being misaligned. Also refer to Figure \ref{fig:closeUpOfSys}.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Put the pulley on the axle.
    \item Attach the axle to one end of the curtain railing so that it is perpendicular to the movement of the curtain. 
    Glue using 2 component super glue, then coat it with a layer of hot glue for stability. 
    The pulley should be close to but not touching the railing.
    \item Use fishing wire to connect the end of curtain to the weight through the pulley, then create a loop further along to hook the servo to.
    \item Use hot glue to secure the servo motor to the model stand just below, but not in the way of, the pulley.
    \item Ensure the servo arm can move freely to release the weight.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Wiring}

The final steps in the assembly of the system is to wire everything up (also refer to Fig. \ref{fig:plot1curtainCircuit}):

\begin{itemize}
    \item Connect the VCC pin of the DS18B20 to Pin 1  on the Raspberry Pi \emph{(RPi)}.
    \item Connect the GND pin of the DS18B20 to Pin 6 on the RPi.
    \item Connect the data pin of the DS18B20 to the GPIO7.

    \item Connect the VCC on the LDR Light Sensor to 5V on the Arduino Nano.
    \item Connect the two GND's together.
    \item Connect the AO (Analog Output) on the LDR to the A5 pin.

    \item Once the servo is attached, connect the GND (negative) wire to pin 20 on the RPi.
    \item Attach the VCC (positive) wire to pin 17 on the RPi.
    \item Connect the sig wire to pin 16 on the RPi

    \item Once the above steps have been completed, attach the Arduino Nano to the RPi via USB cable. Upload `LightSensorTest.ino` to the Arduino Nano.
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./figures/curtainCircuit.pdf}
    \caption{Electronics components of curtain closer. The Raspberry Pi computer directly controls the servo and reads from the digital temperature

    using a 2 Amp transformer with USB-C connector.}
    \label{fig:plot1curtainCircuit}
  \end{figure}

\subsubsection{Software configuration}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Enable the 1-wire protocol on the RPi \cite{url:1wire}.
    \item Upload sofware to Arduino board for reading analog light level values and forwarding to Raspberry Pi. Find details in Section \ref{sec:datalogging}.
    \item Install the dependencies on the command line interface \emph{(CLI)}: \newline \verb|pip install pandas matplotlib numpy RPi.GPIO|.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data logging}
\label{sec:datalogging}

For developing and testing algorithms, it is impractical to work with live data. 
Instead, data should be logged into an easy to read file, and algorithms can then be tested by replaying this file.

The csv log file contains measurements once per second and each measurment needs an accurate time stamp.

Reading the data from the temperature sensor is fairly straightforward, using a one wire protocol\cite{url:digitalTempSensor}. 
This means that it just requires one data line to communicate with the rasberry pi.
Data can then be read from the system file \verb*|/sys/bus/w1/devices/28-3fa9d445207e/w1_slave|, depending on the ID stored on the sensor chip.

A bit more work is required to read light levels from the photoresistor circuit: As these are not digital, an Arduino board is used to convert analog
voltage readings into digital numbers. These digital numbers are written onto a serial link with the following program to be loaded onto the
Arduino board: 

\begin{lstlisting}
const byte Pin1 = A5;

void setup(){
  pinMode(Pin1, INPUT);
  Serial.begin(9600);
}
void loop (){
 long int val1 = analogRead(Pin1);
 Serial.println(val1);
 delay(1000);
}

\end{lstlisting}

The Arduino is connected to the Raspberry Pi with a USB interface, and the values from the Arduino can
therefore be read by opening the system file \verb|/dev/ttyUSB0|, once every second.

The following Python listing illustrates the process of reading data from sensors and clock,
and writing these into a log file.

\begin{listing}
\begin{minted}{python3}
    
# Reading from /sys/bus/w1/devices/28-3fa9d445207e/w1_slave

import os
import glob
import time
import datetime
import serial

device_file = '/sys/bus/w1/devices/28-3fa9d445207e/w1_slave' 

date = str(datetime.datetime.today().strftime("%Y %m %d"))

with open(device_file, 'r') as f, open(date+'.csv', 'w') as outputfile, serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 9600, timeout = 2) as ser:
  while True:
    lines = f.readlines()
    lightval = ser.readline().decode('utf-8')
    ser.reset_input_buffer()
    f.seek(0)
    time.sleep(1)
    try:
      equals_pos = lines[1].find('t=')
    except IndexError:
      print("I",end=' ')
      continue
    if equals_pos != -1:
      temp_string = lines[1][equals_pos+2:]
      temp_c = float(temp_string)/1000
      #print(temp_c)
      measurementRecord = (f'{datetime.datetime.today().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")}, {datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S")}, {int(lightval)}, {temp_c}')
      print(measurementRecord)
      outputfile.write(measurementRecord+"\n")

\end{minted}
\end{listing}

\subsubsection{Data Plotting}

%TODO: discuss matplotlib issues

To easily view the data and possibly develop it, it is necessary to plot the data. 
Figure \ref{fig:plot1} displays logged data for a range of days in winter of 2025.
Plots were generated from the logged data using pandas and matplotlib libraries.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./figures/logDataPlot.pdf}
    \caption{Temperature and light levels logged from 24 February 2025 to 3 March 2025. Ticks on the x-axis indicate midnight of each day.
    Vertical orange lines indicate for each day the time of conditions for 
    curtain closing being met, i.e., temperature dropping for 30 minutes and light levels too low for effective solar heating. There is one point per second. 
    Note that temperature is rising in early mornings (6-8 am) and evenings (5-9pm) following conventional heating system activation. }  
    \label{fig:plot1}
  \end{figure}

\section{Development of closing algorithm}

%TODO Describe observations from log data
%Desrive closing alg / psueducode
%Describe driver program impl for testing

The final step was to develop an algorithm that tells the servo when to close the curtains. 
While originally planned to design a system that returns the percentage chance of the closing time being correct,
it turned out the complexity of the code required was too high, where a simple Boolean output would do. 
The plot shown in Figure \ref{fig:plot1} supported the development of heuristics for closing the curtains, based on the time of the day, 
the temperature dropping by 0.5°C over a period of 30 minutes and there not being enough sunlight to heat the space.
Curtain closure is triggered only in the afternoon or if it is close to sunset. 
Checking the difference between the current temperature value and the value 30 minutes ago, was implemented using a queue holding 1800 values, 
accomodating one measurement per second. Each time a new measurement value is received, it is compared to the first value in the queue, 
and the difference informs of temperature drops by 0.5°C.
Light value readings increase as it gets darker, so once the light value is more than 15 and the temperature also falls, the curtain closes.
In the event that it is simply a very hot day, the curtain system will close around sunset, for which a separate program exists to compute it
unsing a simple sunset formula\cite{url:sunsetEquation}.

The above expressed in pseudo code is shown below.

\begin{verbatim}
if time is pm AND 
    temperature drops for 30 minutes AND 
    light level > 15 OR 
    sunset time reached:
        do: close curtain
\end{verbatim}

\section{Results and discussion}
%TODO short text

The system was tested over the period of a week, and the results proved promising. 
However, in some situations, it may be more benificial to have a more expensive system that can manage itself, capable of both opening, and closing, 
the curtains to adapt to the more unpredictable weather conditions present here in Britain.


\section{Future Work}

Work in progress includes pulling short range weather forecasts information from OpenMeteo\cite{url:openmeteo} for making better decisions 
about curtain closing times.
Reinforment learning techniques have been considered to automate the system, but these are currently out of scope due to lack of training 
data and time.
